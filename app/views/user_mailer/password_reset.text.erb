Hi <%= @user.first_name.capitalize %>,

Sorry you forgot your password but the good news is you can reset it by copying and pasting the link below into your browser

<%= edit_password_reset_url(@user.reset_token, email: @user.email) %>

Note this link will expire in an hour, in which case you may have to make another reset request.

If you did not request to reset your password, please ignore this email and
your password will stay the same.
